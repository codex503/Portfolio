# Portfolio
First project on Udacity front end web developer nanodegree.

      For now I'm satisfied with this project. Mainly because I would like to move on to the other projects in the program.
      I have a few ideas on polishing the portfolio....all of which I do not know how to do just yet however, in due time I
      believe they will be implemented.
